# Movie_Rating
This is my test project, in which, using my knowledge of a web developer, I created a list of films, and sorted them by rating, budget, actors


Hello world, this is a test project Movie_Rating that you can run on your own machine. 
To create and run this project, I used: -Python ver 3.10.5 
-Django ver 4.0.5 
After installing python and django, copy the code to your interpreter and run the command in the terminal:
-python manage.py runserver
The server has been successfully launched, copy the url to your browser and enjoy the project =)
